## Metadatapp Next.js App

Next.js + Tailwind frontend for Metadatapp. The legacy Jekyll site has been removed so this repo now only contains the Next app under `next-app/`.

### Getting started
- `cd next-app`
- Install deps: `npm install`
- Dev server: `npm run dev`
- Production build: `npm run build` then `npm start`

### Notes
- Generated output is ignored (`next-app/.next/`, `next-app/node_modules/`). Build locally as needed.
