    title: "What is MAAP?"
    body: |
      **Vision:** Extract maximum scientific value from every animal used.  
      **Problem:** scattered spreadsheets and siloed systems force repeat studies and missed phenotypes.  
      **Solution:** a FAIR-by-design platform that structures metadata, monitors outcomes, and integrates with your lab stack—so studies are powered, traceable, and reusable.

      MAAP is not a digital notebook or database plumbing. It turns animal experiments into structured, interoperable scientific assets that can be combined, compared, and reanalyzed without re-running cohorts.

      - title: "Scientific rigor"
        body: "Ontologies, standards, and interoperable metadata boost statistical power and translational probability."
      - title: "Ethical responsibility (3Rs)"
        body: "Reduction via reuse; refinement via better monitoring; replacement via better predictions."
      - title: "Operational performance"
        body: "Less reinventing data, accelerated timelines, and AI-ready assets for multi-site programs."

    title: "FAIR by design"
    body: |
      MAAP isn't merely "compatible" with **FAIR**; it makes FAIR measurable:

      - Run multi-site studies without chaos.  
      - Statistical power from better metadata, fewer repeats.  
      - Traceable assets that feed AI/ML and regulatory packages.

    title: "Q & A"
    items:
      - question: "Does MAAP replace my ELN or LIMS?"
        answer: "No. MAAP connects with your existing systems—ELNs, LIMS, HCM platforms—to avoid duplicate entry. It serves as a metadata hub that enriches, links, and harmonizes what you already capture."
      - question: "What kind of data and standards does MAAP support?"
        answer: "MAAP manages preclinical metadata—subjects, protocols, devices, and outcomes—using ontology-based standards (JSON-LD, ARRIVE, FAIR, NWB soon) for full semantic consistency. Learn more in <a href=\"/fair-by-design\">FAIR-by-Design</a>."
      - question: "How does MAAP ensure FAIR, transparent, and ethical research?"
        answer: "MAAP records all subject and experiment life events, enabling traceability, reproducibility, and transparency aligned with ethical best practices."
      - question: "What export and integration options are available?"
        answer: "Export to CSV, JSON, JSON-LD, and RO-CRATE (NWB coming soon), and integrate with analytics tools, publications, or repositories like OSF."
      - question: "Who is MAAP for?"
        answer: "MAAP serves academic labs, CROs, and pharma teams. Its modular architecture scales from small studies to enterprise programs."
