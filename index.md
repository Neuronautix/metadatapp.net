{: .block}

**MetaDatApp** is a platform designed to streamline metadata management for preclinical research. Our solution ensures compliance with **FAIR principles**, seamlessly integrates with laboratory tools such as **LIMS**, colony manager and electronic lab notebooks, and enhances reproducibility by meticulously tracking and recording all relevant experimental data.

Our goal is to empower researchers with tools to simplify research workflows, ensure FAIR compliance, and enhance reproducibility in science. Together, we make research more efficient and impactful.

<h2 id="mapp-is-fair-by-design">MAPP is FAIR-by-design!</h2>
{: .block}
MAPP isn’t merely “compatible” with FAIR; it was engineered around these principles:
- API-first + JSON-LD give universal findability and interoperability.
- Open protocols + OIDC ensure controlled but straightforward accessibility.
- Rich domain schema + provenance hooks drive long-term reusability.
=> FAIR compliance is baked into the MAPP architecture (not bolted on afterwards), making your (meta)data FAIR-by-design !
