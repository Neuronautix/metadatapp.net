        <h1>The Challenge in Modern Research</h1>
        <p>In today's fast-paced scientific landscape, researchers face immense pressure to produce high-impact results. However, the tools for managing the crucial "data about the data"—the metadata—have not kept pace. This leads to common pain points:</p>

        <h1>Our Solution: FAIR-by-Design</h1>
        <p><strong>Metadatapp (MAPP)</strong> was engineered from the ground up to solve these challenges. We are not just another tool; we are a foundational platform for better science.</p>
        <p>Our <strong>API-first architecture</strong> and use of modern standards like <strong>JSON-LD</strong> ensure that your metadata is FAIR-by-design, not as an afterthought. By integrating seamlessly with your existing lab tools (like LIMS and ELNs), MAPP acts as a central hub, eliminating redundant work and capturing a complete, auditable trail of your research lifecycle.</p>
