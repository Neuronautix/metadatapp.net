## Connecting Your Data

MAPP is designed to be the central hub for all your preclinical research (meta)data. We provide seamless integration with popular colony management systems like **SoftMouse.NET** and the new **Fair3R.fr** data repository solution. You can also easily import data from your behavioral experiments using our external CSV import tool.

MAPP takes care of all the heavy lifting, including:

*   **Data harmonization:** We normalize your data from different sources into a single, consistent format.
*   **Metadata enrichment:** We automatically add relevant metadata to your data, making it more discoverable and reusable.
*   **Data validation:** We ensure that your data is complete and accurate.

With MAPP, you can finally have a single source of truth for all your preclinical research data.

MAPP also come with a range of plugins and features that adapt to YOUR specific needs and makes your research pipeline more efficient!
Stop loosing time with data management, make it FAIR without investing additional efforts!
