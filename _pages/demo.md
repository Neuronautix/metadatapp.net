## Connecting Your Data

MAPP is designed to be the central hub for all your preclinical research data. We provide seamless integration with popular colony management systems like **MAS SoftMouse.Net** and **Fair3R.fr**. You can also easily import data from your behavioral experiments using our external CSV import tool.

MAPP takes care of all the heavy lifting, including:

*   **Data harmonization:** We normalize your data from different sources into a single, consistent format.
*   **Metadata enrichment:** We automatically add relevant metadata to your data, making it more discoverable and reusable.
*   **Data validation:** We ensure that your data is complete and accurate.

With MAPP, you can finally have a single source of truth for all your preclinical research data.
